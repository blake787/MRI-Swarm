## Overview
MRI Swarm is an enterprise-grade system designed to enhance the analysis of MRI scans. Utilizing Swarms, the leading production-ready multi-agent framework, it coordinates a team of specialized agents. Each agent focuses on different aspects of MRI interpretation, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate analysis. This approach allows for better diagnostic insights and improves patient care.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Efficiently manages multiple agents working in parallel.
- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent specializes in a different area of MRI analysis.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales to handle large volumes of data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies interaction for healthcare professionals.
- **Robust Performance**: Delivers reliable results in a timely manner.

## Installation
To get started with MRI Swarm, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blake787/MRI-Swarm.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MRI-Swarm
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Use pip to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/blake787/MRI-Swarm/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions provided there to execute the application.

## Usage
After installation, you can start using MRI Swarm to analyze MRI scans. Hereâ€™s how to run the application:

1. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. **Upload MRI Scans**:
   Use the interface to upload your MRI scans for analysis.

4. **Review Results**:
   Once the analysis is complete, review the detailed reports generated by the agents.

## Architecture
MRI Swarm is built on a microservices architecture. Each agent operates independently, allowing for parallel processing. This design ensures that the system remains responsive, even under heavy load.

### Components
- **Agent Manager**: Oversees the communication between agents.
- **Data Processor**: Handles incoming MRI scans and distributes them to the appropriate agents.
- **Result Aggregator**: Collects results from all agents and compiles them into a final report.

## Agents
MRI Swarm consists of several specialized agents, each focusing on different aspects of MRI analysis:

- **Image Preprocessing Agent**: Cleans and prepares the MRI images for analysis.
- **Tumor Detection Agent**: Identifies potential tumors within the scans.
- **Anomaly Detection Agent**: Looks for unusual patterns that may indicate other health issues.
- **Report Generation Agent**: Compiles findings into a structured report for healthcare professionals.
